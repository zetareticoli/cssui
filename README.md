# CSSUI

CSSUI is a front-end library that includes a variety of CSS user interface components. These can be used to construct modern and responsive web applications.

## Getting Started

To use the components in this repository, download or clone it to your local machine. Once you have the files, copy the necessary CSS code and paste it into your project's CSS file.

Demo and documentation available [here](https://www.cssui.dev/).

Each component has its own CSS file with its specific styles. You can use these components on their own or combine them to build more complex user interfaces.

## Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-ui-lib) to install CSSUI in your project:

```bash
npm install css-ui-lib
```

## Usage

The library includes:
- `cssui.css`, a global stylesheet which contains the CSS variables used by all components.
- components folder list

Each component folder includes two files:

1. HTML template file
2. CSS stylesheet.

You can use template files as partial or copy/paste the code into the project's files according to your needs.

### Customization

You can customize all the CSS code in this repository to fit your design needs. You can also add your own styles to the components for more customization.
